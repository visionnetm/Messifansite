    Lionel Andrés Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. From a young age, he stood out for his talent in football, and his parents quickly noticed his extraordinary abilities. At the age of six, he started playing at a local club called Grandoli, with support from his family and friends. Messi developed rapidly, although he faced growth hormone deficiencies during childhood. In his early years, he played at local academies and already attracted attention with his technical skills, ball control, speed, and agility. At the age of 13, when Barcelona offered to cover his medical expenses and integrate him into their academy, Messi and his family moved to Spain. This was the first step toward becoming a football legend.
